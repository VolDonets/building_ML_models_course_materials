# Descriptions of the 2024-2025 content of lab works:

0. Just initialization of Jupyter Notebook and some basic practice.
1. Using ML models (Supervised learning) for solving regression problem (+ example). 
2. Using ML models (Supervised learning) for solving classification problem (+ example).
3. Using ML methods (Unsupervised learning) for data separation (different clustering methods) (+ example).
4. Intro to ANNs, hand-crafting ANN models from scratch using only Numpy + training realization.
5. Intro to ANNs 2nd part, fully-connected Vs conv on Fashion MNIST dataset.


# Description of the 2025-2026 content of lab works (DRAFT):

1. Building and training own ANN model for solving any of previously discussed problem.
   It could be either classification either regression, and so on.
2. ML models explainability.
3. ANNs for work with image (classification problem), training from scratch on a manually
   created dataset (cats Vs dogs, tumors, plants diseases and so on).
   Also, considering transfer learning.
   BONUS TASK: trying model's explainability for explaining predictors by your ANN's.
4. Working with sequential data text and sound analyzing models.
   RNN, LSTM, Transformers
5. Generative model: Trying basic models, from variational autoencoders, GANs, 
   trained AutoRegressive models, and Diffusion Models.
